Omg ganda I’m SO sorry if I didn't pick up the phone the first time. I probably got caught up on my responsibilities in DK, acads, and other things. But that doesn’t mean na I’m not thinking of you! I am ALWAYSS thinking of you, you’re the first person I think about when I open my eyes from sleeping. I didn’t forget about you, ganda. It’s just that responsibilities get in the fricken way and I can’t stop that. Please do know I will contact you as soon as possible, you are my prio! And if you think na you shouldn’t be my prio WELL YOU’RE REALLY WRONG. You’re my happiness, why would I not make that my prio? Anyways please sit tight! Reese is trying her best.
