    I’m very sorry because I’ve done something that made you feel jealous. I’m not perfect, so please tell me why and who and I will gladly make solutions that will be fair for the both of us. Please don’t keep it to yourself, I’m here for you always which means if you feel jealous you should tell me. Please also know that I will gladly choose you in every situation, in every lifetime, in every multiverse, in every alternate reality. I’m not going to choose anyone else, ikaw lang talaga hanggang dulo.
