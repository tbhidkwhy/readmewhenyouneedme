Since you need to smile I’m gonna make kwento on how I fell for you:

September ‘to, sabi ko studies muna ako (ulol). Pero bigla kitang napagmasdan ng matagal. Ewan ko ba pero nung napagmasdan kita in that moment I fell na agad. Tas when you smile it’s like my world stops and nagsslow mo sayo. Tapos you always made me happy. Even in the stupidest ways. Whenever we spent time together noon I never remember not smiling that time. As time went on, I found myself looking at you longer and I found myself realizing— you’re the one that I want to be with. You’re someone that I can be myself with and there would be no judgement involved. You made me smile a lot and you made me grateful for living. You’re someone that I found comfort in even if you were just being yourself. I can never thank you enough for that. I also found myself noon na hinahanap hanap na kita kasi at that point I just wanted to see you—know that you’re there kasi ikaw talaga kumukumpleto ng mga araw ko. I was willing to risk it all, literally. Kaya nga siguro nung tinanong mo ko kung kanino about yung mga reposts ko sinagot ko na kagad HAHAHAHAHAHA. You are my favorite part of everyday and totoong totoo yun.
