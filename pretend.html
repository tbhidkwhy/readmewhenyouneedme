Gandaa!! Whyket naman?? I understand that you’re pleasing everyone with everything that you can but it’s okay not to be okay pooo!!! It’s your emotions and you need to feel your emotions, not suppress them. It’s really bad for your health when you do things like thaaatt you shouldn’t do it ganda, it’s not worth it. I understand your reasons pero you should avoid doing so kasi like I said its’s really bad for your health. Eh kung masanay kaa? How would I know if you’re okay or not? If I don’t know what you’re feeling how can I help you?? Waaah please be transparent!! Kahit sakin lang muna, kasi you don’t have to hide from me naman po eh.
