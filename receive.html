    Hi, Ganda! This is Reese, your manliligaw and I started this project October 5, 2025. I planned & started this project cause there are times where I’m not gonna be there for you and I hope this helps. I wanted to do this as the physical copy but makulit utak ko and I wanted to code for you. I apologize if I have some grammatical errors in some of my messages here. Think of this as a small token of appreciation for being the person I look forward to everyday. I will continue to edit this project even if I give it to you na. I hope you like it, mwaps!
